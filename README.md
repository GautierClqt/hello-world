# hello-world
This is a description... and also my first repository. You have to start somewhere it's important to know were you come from.

My name is Gautier, as I'm writing this I'm on the path to become an Android developer. I have a bit of knowledge and experience in programing but I have a lot to learn.
I hope to achieve my goals and become a true developer, creating useful programs, helping others, learning every day and making a life with it.
So far I have a lot of idea about what I want to create, I should write them down. Thing is I have no idea how hard it will be for some of them, but I guess I will not be able to everything by myself.
Well, I'll see, for now, I have to learn pratically everything.

I'm looking forward to be a part of Github.

In the meantime wish me goodluck!
bye :)
